# Inspiration 
Online reviews from customers have created a new field in marketing and communication that bridges the gap between traditional word-of-mouth and a viral form of feedback that can influence consumers’ opinions. Analyzing reviews left by your customers, helps your business understand overall customer satisfaction, as they can provide your business with feedback regarding what your customers truly want. Consumers that take the time to leave an online review for your business are far more likely to feel a certain loyalty to you and keep coming back. Through the act of leaving a review and establishing a relationship with your business, it allows consumers to feel like they have a voice even behind a desktop and/or mobile and/ or tablet screen and are able to provide feedback in a positive and meaningful way. This project aims at creating a platform for small businesses to get customer feedback easily and make a summarised report on what your customer thinks about your business.

We built it using Courier's API, Firebase, Replit, Cohere's NLP, Flask, and Python. We used Courier's API for our platform's email notifications, Firebase for storing the data online, Replit for developing our app and hosting our Backend, and Flask as our Backend. We used Cohere's NLP API for processing the review data and making it into a feedback report to send to the business owner
